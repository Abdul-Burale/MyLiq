# Platform Layer for Windows.h - CPU Rendering (Work-in-Progress)

This is a platform layer written in C for Windows.h that focuses on CPU rendering. It provides a foundation for building applications that perform rendering operations on the CPU in a Windows environment.

**Note: This project is a work-in-progress and not yet complete. It is intended for testing and experimentation purposes.**

## Features

- Platform layer for Windows.h that facilitates CPU rendering operations.
- Provides an interface for managing windows, input, and rendering tasks.
- Supports basic functionality for rendering on the CPU using Windows.h APIs.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run the platform layer, you need the following:

- Windows operating system
- C compiler compatible with Windows.h
